		<p>&emsp;Born and raised just outside of Concord, NH, I enjoy giving back to my community by helping small, local companies add character to their web presence with modern, user-friendly, and comprehensive sites catered to the needs of their businesses. With my years of web development experience, I can add additional functionality and cutting edge features, attract new users, and create sites that your existing clients will return to month after month.

						&emsp;I began developing web pages as a hobby 5 years ago. After creating my first site navigation I was hooked and started searching the internet for resources to hone my skills. Eventually, I changed my undergraduate major so I could continue studying what I love: web development. I have studied everything from the basic structure of a website to user-experience principles and e-commerce. My education has strengthened my skill-set and has allowed me to begin freelancing for businesses across New England. I plan on finishing my formal education and making my career in development a full-time endeavor so I can focus my efforts on my passion for life-long learning.

			        &emsp;I develop in Mac iOS using Sublime Text Editor and Google Chrome. I focus on mobile first design so your site will work on a desktop and a mobile phone alike. I work with a graphic designer to help you capture the best images for your pages and, proficient in Photoshop, I can take your designs and make them come to life in the browser. Your needs and vision are important to me, and I strive to bring all your ideas to fruition. If you would like to have a site that you can update and edit yourself without knowing how to code, I can help you set up a WordPress site that will allow you to make simple changes like adding daily menus or special events. We can link your site to your social media pages so that all your public communication is in sync. Reach out today so we can discuss the potential for improving your online image.

						&emsp;Once I realized that I wanted to follow my dream of becoming a developer I changed my degree focus from Sociology to Information Technology, the closest thing my university had to Computer Science. I completed my Associate of Science degree in mid-2016 before enrolling in a Bachelor of Arts in General Studies. This change allowed me to complete all of the universityâ€™s web-related classes and design my own degree. I will graduate in May of 2017 before beginning my Master of Science in Software Development.

						&emsp;I am currently employed as an Admission Counselor II at an online university. This position allows me to work one-on-one with prospective students who are researching the school and considering attending. I help hundreds of applicants every year as they progress through the admission process on their way to enrollment. Using Microsoft Office, Microsoft Dynamics, and Sharepoint, I manage applicant records to ensure that the experience is smooth and meets the unique needs of every individual. My strong communication skills, attention to detail, and ability to work on a team of counselors allow me to improve semester after semester while working against fast-approaching deadlines and challenging team goals.
